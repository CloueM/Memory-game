# MatchaMoji 🍵

This is one of my project games for **Web Scripting 1 in BCIT**, where I'm learning how to use **JavaScript** and **SCSS** together to build interactive web applications.

## About the Game

MatchaMoji is a fun, matcha-themed memory matching game!

- Flip the cards to find matching pairs before the timer runs out.
- Test your memory and speed with multiple difficulty levels (Chill, Easy, Medium, Hard, and WTH).
- Compete for the highest score, which is calculated based on your accuracy, time left, and chosen difficulty multiplier.

## How to Install & Play

Since this is a client-side web application built with HTML, CSS (compiled from SCSS), and JavaScript, no complex installation or server setup is required.

### 1. Download the Game

Clone the repository or download the project files as a ZIP archive and extract them to your local computer.

### 2. Run the Game

Navigate to the extracted project folder and simply double-click the `index.html` file. It will automatically open and run in your default web browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).

### Optional: For Developers (Editing SCSS)

If you want to modify the styling and explore the SCSS code:

1. Open the project folder in a code editor like [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the **Live Server** extension to serve the files locally.
3. Install the **Live Sass Compiler** extension to compile any changes you make in the `.scss` files into the `styles/styles.css` output directory automatically.

Enjoy! 🍵
